In this demo, participants will learn the basics of using Github repositories for version control, and practice the following functions:  
- **Fork**  
- **Clone**  
- **Commit**  
- **Push**  

They will also get practice collaborating on repositories, including best practices for working simultaneously and resolving conflicts. Data for this activity comes from [OpenDataPhilly.](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10b/representationdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10f/)


### Part 1: Using Github repositories
1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Clone** it to your laptop in Github desktop by pasting the repo URL
3. Edit the markdown, slightly changing the code for the map. Save once you're satisfied.
4. Go to Github Desktop to **commit** and **push** your changes.
5. Go to github.com to see your changes reflected.

### Part 2: Collaborating and [resolving conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)
1. Pair up. Person A should invite the Person B to collaborate on their **forked** repo in settings.
2. Person B **clones** Person A's repo to their laptop.
3. Person A edits the map, then saves, **commits**, and **pushes**.
4.  *THIS IS IMPORTANT:* **Without pulling origin**, Person B edits the same map, then saves, **commits**, and **pushes**.
5.  At this point, you should have your first **conflict**! Conflicts in Github are marked by the following: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.
6.  Remove/keep the final changes you and your partner agree on. Also delete the conflict markers.
7.  Once you're both satisfied, click **commit merge** and push to Github.com.

Work together to resolve it safely and ask each other for help. Good luck!
