In this demo, participants will learn the basics of using Github repositories for version control, and practice the following functions:  
- **Fork**  
- **Clone**  
- **Commit**  
- **Push**  

They will also get practice collaborating on repositories, including best practices for working simultaneously and resolving conflicts. Data for this activity comes from [OpenDataPhilly.](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10b/representationdetails/5dc1aeb93741fa001504b10f/)


### Part 2: Collaborating and [resolving conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)
1. Pair up. Person A should invite the Person B to collaborate on their **forked** repo in settings.
2. Person B **clones** Person A's repo to their laptop.
3. Person A edits the map, then saves, **commits**, and **pushes**.
4.  *THIS IS IMPORTANT:* **Without pulling origin**, Person B edits the same map, then saves, **commits**, and **pushes**.
5.  At this point, you should have your first **conflict**! Conflicts in Github are marked by the following: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>.
6.  Remove/keep the final changes you and your partner agree on. Also delete the conflict markers.
7.  Once you're both satisfied, click **commit merge** and push to Github.com.

Work together to resolve it safely and ask each other for help. Good luck!
